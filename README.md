# Repositori for Laravel Apps

Repository for Laravel Apps, writen in PHP with Framework Laravel Version `8.x`.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Database Migration

Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to define and share the application's database schema definition. If you have ever had to tell a teammate to manually add a column to their local database schema after pulling in your changes from source control, you've faced the problem that database migrations solve.

The Laravel `Schema` `facade` provides database agnostic support for creating and manipulating tables across all of Laravel's supported database systems. Typically, migrations will use this facade to create and modify database tables and columns.

If you need to alter the database on your development:

1. Create migration file: `php artisan make:migration {description}`.
   1. Example : `php artisan make:migration create_flights_table`
   2. Write your up and down queries in the generated files accordingly.
   3. See migration file samples in `app/database/migrations`.
2. To verify your migration queries:
   1. Execute `php artisan migrate` and verify the result in the database.
   2. This will also update the row in _migration table_ (table name is in .env).
   3. Do not forget to drop your changes to go back to previous database state: `php artisan migrate:rollback`
